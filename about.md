# ProfileBio
Allows you to have an "About me" section in your profile.

**how to upload a bio?**
*[currently for windows users only]*
- go to your profile. you might see a "show bio" button, but it will just say that you don't have a bio if you don't, there'll be a "add about me" button, just click that.
- it's pretty straightforward from there.

server files are on github :)
