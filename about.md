# ProfileBio
allows you to have an "About me" section in your profile.

**how to upload a bio?**
*[currently for desktop users only]*
- go to your profile. you'll see an "add about me" button, just click that.
- it's pretty straightforward from there.

note that it crashes on private servers.

thanks [RayDeeUx](user:1941705) for the logo

server files are on github :)

**note that this crashes on gdpss. this is really only meant for official GD servers.**
